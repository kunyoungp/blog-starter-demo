In today's global digital landscape, providing instant, accurate information to website visitors around the clock is essential. **Informe** is Mindlogic's intelligent website chatbot solution that transforms your organizational documents into an always-available, multilingual assistant.

## Document-Based Intelligence

Informe learns from your organization's existing knowledge base—manuals, FAQs, policies, guides, and any other documentation you provide. Using advanced document processing and machine learning, Informe creates a comprehensive understanding of your organization's information.

When a visitor asks a question, Informe retrieves the most relevant information from your documents and provides accurate, contextual answers in real-time.

## 24/7 Availability in Multiple Languages

Your customers and stakeholders don't operate on a 9-to-5 schedule, and neither should your support. Informe provides:

- **Round-the-clock availability**: Answer questions any time of day or night
- **Multilingual support**: Communicate in multiple languages to serve global audiences
- **Instant responses**: No waiting in queues or for business hours
- **Consistent information**: Every visitor receives accurate, up-to-date answers

## Advanced RAG Technology

Like our other solutions, Informe leverages cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology:

- **Precise Question Analysis**: Query reformulation and multi-query decomposition ensure the system understands what visitors are really asking
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines multiple search strategies to find the most relevant information
- **Continuous Evaluation**: The system constantly improves accuracy based on interactions

## Secure Deployment Options

For organizations with sensitive information or strict data governance requirements, Informe offers **on-premise deployment**. Your documents and visitor interactions remain on your internal servers, ensuring complete data privacy and compliance.

## Real-World Applications

Informe serves diverse organizational needs:

- **Universities**: Help students find course information, admission requirements, and campus resources
- **Enterprises**: Guide employees through policies, procedures, and internal documentation
- **Government Agencies**: Provide citizens with instant access to public services information
- **Customer Service**: Reduce support ticket volume by answering common questions automatically
